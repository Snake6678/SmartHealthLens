Got it ‚Äî here‚Äôs the **final recruiter-ready README.md** you can drop straight into your repo before running the Git commands I gave you.  
This version is clean, professional, and has **no AI mentions** anywhere.

SmartHealthLens is an on-device, privacy-first project that estimates **heart rate** from subtle changes in skin tone captured by a camera. It runs entirely on-device, demonstrating real-time computer vision, signal processing, and edge AI deployment using **SwiftUI**, **Core ML**, **OpenCV**, and **PyTorch**.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Real-time rPPG** heart-rate estimation from webcam or iOS camera feed.
- **Forehead ROI tracking** via face detection for faster, more stable readings.
- **SwiftUI iOS app** with live preview, HR display, and step cadence from Core Motion.
- **Core ML export hooks** for integrating trained PyTorch models.
- **Privacy-first**: All processing is performed locally, with no cloud connections.

## üöÄ Quick Start ‚Äî macOS Webcam Demo
```bash
cd realtime-demo
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo_webcam_hr.py
```
**Tips:**  
- Use steady, diffuse lighting.  
- Keep your forehead inside the green rectangle.  
- Wait ~20‚Äì40 seconds for a stable BPM reading.  

Press **ESC** to exit.

---

## üì± iOS App (SwiftUI)
1. In Xcode ‚Üí New ‚Üí iOS App (SwiftUI).
2. Drag files from `ios/SmartHealthLens/` into your project (copy if needed).
3. Add to **Info.plist**:
   - `Privacy - Camera Usage Description`
   - `Privacy - Motion Usage Description`
4. Build and run on a physical iOS device.

---

## üß† Model Training ‚Üí Core ML (Optional)
```bash
cd model-training
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_stub.py
python export_coreml.py  # produces TinyHR.mlmodel
```
Place `TinyHR.mlmodel` into the iOS app and replace the FFT-based estimator with model inference.

---

## ‚öô How It Works
1. Capture frames using AVFoundation (iOS) or OpenCV (macOS).
2. Detect face and isolate forehead region for optimal signal quality.
3. Extract average green-channel intensity per frame.
4. Detrend and normalize signal, then apply FFT.
5. Identify dominant frequency in 0.7‚Äì4.0 Hz band ‚Üí convert to BPM.

```
Camera ‚Üí Forehead ROI ‚Üí mean(G) ‚Üí detrend ‚Üí normalize ‚Üí FFT ‚Üí peak ‚Üí BPM
```

## üõ† Roadmap
- [ ] Replace FFT method with Core ML model for HR and breathing rate.
- [ ] Add ARKit overlay for ROI placement.
- [ ] Integrate Apple Watch data for sensor fusion.
- [ ] Use Vision framework for face mesh to improve accuracy in motion/shadow.
- [ ] Add automated tests and CI.

## üêõ Troubleshooting ‚Äî macOS Camera Access
If you see ‚Äúnot authorized to capture video‚Äù:
```bash
tccutil reset Camera
```
Then go to: **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí enable Terminal/iTerm/VS Code**.  
If the problem persists, install:
```bash
pip install pyobjc-core==10.3 pyobjc-framework-AVFoundation==10.3
```
This triggers a native macOS permission prompt.
